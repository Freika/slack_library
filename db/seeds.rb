# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
# ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute("TRUNCATE #{books}")
# Book.delete_all
# # Book.create!(isbn: '9781941222126')
# require 'googlebooks' # unless you're using Bundler
# results = GoogleBooks.search('ruby', :count => 30)
# puts "Total results for the term 'ruby': #{results.count}"
# for book in results
#   image = book.image_link ? book.image_link(:zoom => 2) : ""

#   @book = Book.create(title: book.title, isbn: book.isbn, lang: book.language,
#                       published_date: book.published_date,
#                       description: book.description, remote_cover_url: image)
#   book.authors_array.each do |a|
#     author = Author.find_or_create_by(:name => a)
#     author.save
#     @book.authors << author
#   end
